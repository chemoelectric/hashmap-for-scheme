= Hashmaps for Scheme

An implementation of hash array mapped tries for Scheme. This
implementation may be used directly or as an underlying hashmap
implementation for, say, SRFI-146.

The library is still under development. Insertion has been written,
but deletion and tree walks have not.

footnote:[I have long had an ATS2 implementation of hash tries. Once
translated from ATS2, this can be compiled with just a C compiler. It
employs proofs and linear types for safety and requires only that
stored objects be allocated to fixed locations, in the manner of a
malloc. Garbage collection is not required. I may one day add this
implementation as FFI for compatible Schemes.]
