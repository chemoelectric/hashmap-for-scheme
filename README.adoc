= Hashmaps for Scheme

An implementation of hash array mapped tries for Scheme. This
implementation may be used directly or as an underlying hashmap
implementation for, say, SRFI-146.footnote:[I have long had an ATS2
implementation of hash tries. Once translated from ATS2, this can be
compiled with just a C compiler. It employs proofs and linear types
for safety and requires only that stored objects be allocated to fixed
locations, in the manner of a malloc. Garbage collection is not
required. I may one day add this implementation as FFI for compatible
Schemes.]

The library is now in working condition.
